Programming Challenge:

Given a set of integer ranges in the form (start, end) build
a data structure that efficiently represents the available
ranges.  Provide the following APIs:

AddRange(start, end)
	Given a new range, insert it into the datastructure.

HasRange(start, end) returns true or false
	The entire requested range is available
